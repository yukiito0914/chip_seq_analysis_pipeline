# Week2
## Plotting correlation between bigWigs
I used **spearman correlation** to calculate the correlation between the bigWig files, as 
the data is not necessarily normally distributed.

## Generating a set of reproducible peaks with bedtools intersect
I defined reproducible peaks as those that exhibited at least a 50% reciproposal overlap 
between the two replicated, rep1 and rep2.

## Filtering peaks found in ENCODE blacklist regions
I removed peaks that overlapped a blacklisted region by at least 1bp.
